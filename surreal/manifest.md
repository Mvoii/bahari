### 1. **Network Architecture (P2P)**
   - **Decentralized Network**: Each client (user) acts as both a server and a client, with no central authority. You'll need to build a P2P architecture where each user connects directly with other users in the group.
   - **Connection Management**: Implement a discovery mechanism so that devices in the group can find each other. You can use technologies like:
     - **mDNS (Multicast DNS)** or **DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery)** to allow devices on the same local network to discover each other.
     - **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** for decentralized node discovery and routing.

### 2. **Message Synchronization**
   - **Timestamp-Based Syncing**: Use timestamps to keep messages in order. Each message gets a timestamp upon sending, and each device syncs messages based on this timestamp. You can use protocols like **Lamport Timestamps** to handle clock differences.
   - **CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)**: If two or more users send messages at the same time, CRDTs can help resolve conflicts automatically, ensuring that the order of messages is consistent across all devices.
   - **Message Broadcasting**: When a user sends a message, broadcast it to all other devices. Each device acknowledges the message, and if one device misses it, the group can help it recover.

### 3. **Message Disappearance Mechanism**
   - **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Assign a lifespan (TTL) to each message. Once the message's TTL expires, the message is deleted from both the sender and the recipients' devices. 
   - **Message Deletion Syncing**: Ensure that when a message is deleted on one device (after the TTL), it's also deleted on all other devices by broadcasting the deletion event.
   - **Secure Erasure**: Use secure delete algorithms to ensure that the message data is wiped from storage properly.

### 4. **Communication Protocols**
   - **WebSockets**: Great for real-time communication, allowing you to establish a persistent connection between peers.
   - **Peer-to-Peer WebRTC**: WebRTC can handle P2P connections for low-latency data transmission. You can use this to send messages directly between devices.
   - **TCP/UDP Sockets**: For lower-level control, you could build your own messaging protocol on top of TCP (reliable) or UDP (faster, but may lose messages).

### 5. **Encryption and Security**
   - **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**: Ensure all messages are encrypted during transmission and storage. You can use libraries like **libsodium** or **OpenSSL** for encryption.
   - **Forward Secrecy**: Implement key exchanges (e.g., using **Diffie-Hellman**) to ensure that each conversation uses a unique encryption key, making it harder to decrypt past messages if keys are compromised.

### 6. **Peer Discovery and Joining**
   - **Bootstrap Nodes**: One node can act as a bootstrap for other devices to join the network. Once connected, each user can discover and connect to others in the group.
   - **Gossip Protocol**: To keep all peers in sync, a gossip protocol could propagate message and membership updates efficiently throughout the network.

### 7. **Handling Offline Users**
   - **Message Buffering**: If a user is temporarily offline, store the messages locally or on another peer temporarily until they reconnect, ensuring no data is lost.
